The \"concert-this\" command searches the Bandsintown API for upcoming performances by the artist provided by the user. The \"spotify-this-song\" command queries the Spotify API for information about the user-specified song. The \"movie-this\" command searches the OMDB API for information about the user-specified movie. Results are printed in the console and also recorded in a '.txt' file."
